Patient case: A 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia 
presents with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, 
diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. The patient is tachycardic and hypotensive. 
What is the differential diagnosis? What initial investigations should be ordered?

Provide:
1. List possible diagnoses
2. Suggest initial investigations
3. Explain reasoning step by step
4. Give a concise final answer

1. Possible diagnoses:
   - Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   - Pneumothorax: Caused by rapid breathing and tachycardia.
   - Pulmonary embolism (PE): Severe chest pain can be a symptom of PE.
   - Atrial fibrillation (AF): Can cause symptoms similar to ACS.
   - Severe aortic stenosis: Can mimic ACS symptoms.
   - Dissecting aortic aneurysm: Can cause chest pain and radiating symptoms.
   - Panic attack: Can cause similar symptoms of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

2. Suggested initial investigations:
   - Cardiac biomarkers (troponin): To rule out ACS, especially STEMI.
   - Electrocardiogram (ECG): To assess heart rhythm and ischemic changes.
   - Chest X-

Tasks:
1. Identify any errors or hallucinations in the responses
2. Rank the responses by reasoning quality
3. Provide a single concise final answer based on the best reasoning
4. Summarize the final answer in 1-2 sentences

Final Answer:
The best response is Council Member 2. The response provides a clear and concise list of possible diagnoses, initial investigations, and reasoning step by step. The suggested investigations are also well-considered and appropriate for the patient's presentation.

Summary:
The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), but other diagnoses such as aortic dissection or pneumothorax should also be considered. Initial investigations should include an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (troponin), and D-dimer to rule out ACS and PE, as well as a chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumothorax or other lung-related issues. Echocardiography may also be useful to evaluate for aortic dissection or heart valve dysfunction.
